We considered two stcks: MERN and MEAN. 
We initially considered these two as our candidates because they are the most widely used stacks today and we thought it was a good place to start.
More importantly, some of us had previously used mongoDB and Node before, so this was an obvious choice.
The real choice had to be made between Angular and React. No one on the team had any substantial experience with Angular, but some of us had a good amount of experience with
React, so we decided to go with the MERN stack.
