As a user I want to be able to make a list of songs that I want to listen to
Basic flow: On every song, users will see a button that allows them to add it to their playlist. In their profile they will be able to adjust the playlist by removing items. Beside every item they will be able to see their friends who also want to listen to the particular song or genre.
Alternative flow: After linking music streaming service account users will be asked if they want to add items of the playlists from this platform to their global playlist.

Alternative flow: if you use your facebook/google account for sign up you will be able to add friends who also use our app from these services.
I want to listen to the music with friends.
