Friend-list and Watch-together feature case:
As a user I want to be able to make a list of movies/shows that I want to watch  
Basic flow: On every movie/show, users will see a button that allows them to add it to their watchlist. In their profile they will be able to adjust the wishlist by removing items. Beside every item they will be able to see their friends who also want to watch the particular movie/show.
Alternative flow: After linking streaming service account users will be asked if they want to add items of the watchlist from this platform to their global watchlist. 
I want to add friends and see their wishlists to know what they want to watch.
Basic flow: In the personal profile you will be able to see your friendlist. There will be a specific button to add friends. Clicking on it you will be able to look for your friends by their username.
Alternative flow: if you use your facebook/google account for sign up you will be able to add friends who also use our app from these services.
