Main app:
IF PROFILE IS COMPLETE (connected to music streaming services/selected favourite songs/albums/artists)
When we have a profile on the user that we can run our algorithm on, then we can allow the user to personalize their “recommendations” from our algorithm. Although we will generate all recommendations from all platforms based on the user's profile, we will only show the user songs/playlists from the platforms that they selected to see.
After logging in, the user has an option to connect to any amount of platform accounts, note  or all of their accounts from a list of music streaming platforms like Amazon Music, Spotify, Deezer, and others. So the user can also select music streaming platforms that they’re not interested in
Check “Connecting Music Streaming Services”
If the user does not want to connect their music streaming services for whatever reason, we will have a general selection of good recommendations from all types of genres. If the user wants specific genres, they could use the nav bar at the top of the app which will allow users to customize their recommendations without having to connect to a music streaming service.
Although connecting to music streaming services is recommended for our app usage, we will not force the users to login to any of their accounts
The overall layout of the main app is follow:
A nav bar at the top of the application (prob full width), with our user’s name at the top left, followed with the options to select what genre of songs the user wants to see. The setting button will be at the top right of the nav bar. The options for customization will include:
Song name
Genre
Artist
Album
Then a song recommendation list is shown below the nav bar, with titles, albums they belong to, name of the artists, and other information being displayed under the picture of the playlist and the user can “scroll” up or down to access different songs, similar to how Spotify organizes their playlists.
Then we have the options to go to their friend-list and share songs we enjoy
