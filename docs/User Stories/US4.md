Main app:
IF PROFILE IS COMPLETE (connected to streaming services/selected favourite movies/shows)
When we have a profile on the user that we can run our algorithm on, then we can allow the user to personalize their “recommendations” from our algorithm. Although we will generate all recommendations from all platforms based on the user's profile, we will only show the user shows/movies from the platforms that they selected to see.
After logging in, the user has an option to connect to any amount of platform accounts, note  or all of their accounts from a list of streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and others. So the user can also select streaming platforms that they’re not interested in
Check “Connecting streaming services”
If the user does not want to connect their streaming services for whatever reason, we will have a general selection of good recommendations from all types of genres and themes. If the user wants specific genres, they could use the nav bar at the top of the app which will allow users to customize their recommendations without having to connect to a streaming service.
Although connecting to streaming services is recommended for our app usage, we will not force the users to login to any of their accounts
The overall layout of the main app is follow:
A nav bar at the top of the application (prob full width), with our user’s name at the top left, followed with the options to select what genre of movies/show the user wants to see. The setting button will be at the top right of the nav bar. The options for customization will include:
Movies/shows
Genre
Then a movie/show recommendation slideshow is shown below the nav bar, with titles and ratings and other info about the movie/show under the picture, the user can “scroll” to the left or right, similar to how Netflix organizes their shows.
Then we have the options to go to their watch-together/friend-list
