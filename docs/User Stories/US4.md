Main app:
IF PROFILE IS COMPLETE (connected to streaming services/selected favourite movies/shows)
When we have a profile on the user that we can run our algorithm on, then we can allow the user to enter 
After logging in, the user has an option to connect any or all of their accounts from a list of streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, and others. So the user can also select streaming platforms that they’re not interested in
Check “Connecting streaming services”
As a user, I want movie/show recommendations for Hulu/Netflix based on my other Hulu/Netflix accounts
Additionally, I want recommendations from the platforms I do not currently own from the ones I choose in settings, or at random.
I want to see a interface that shows all the movies/shows I want to watch in an organized and easy to check-out manner
Separate tab for each platform that displays shows and movies recommended to the user
Interface will mainly display name of the movie, as well as the poster picture to catch an eye of a viewer
If a user is in a mood of a specific genre, length, or time period it was filmed, the recommended movies will be categorized based on that, thus appear in that specific tab
As a user I want to see more information about the movies I get recommended
Once you hover over any recommended movie poster, it will start playing middle or the beginning of the trailer for the movie itself, as well as display extra information on the side, mainly:
Date of the movie release, genre, movie length, small 1-2 sentence description to hype the viewer, and IMDB/Rotten Tomatoes ratings of the movie.
Also there will be an icon of the streaming services the movie is currently available on somewhere there
