Connecting streaming services:
User is at the home screen after logging in, and there is a button for “Link streaming services” in the top left corner.
User clicks on the button and a streaming service selection dialog box appears with a button for each streaming service and a button to “Finish”
The user then clicks on one of the buttons and a login box for that service appears. The login box has a textbox for the username/email and another for password. There is also a “cancel” button below that the user can click to bring them back to the streaming service selection dialog box.
The user then enters their username and password for that service.
If the login is successful, a dialog is displayed “Service successfully linked!”
If the login is unsuccessful, the user is given a message saying the login was unsuccessful and is prompted to re enter their username and password. They could also click the “cancel” button.
The user is then brought back to the streaming service selection dialog box.
If the user would like to link another streaming service, they just repeat this process. If not, they click “Finish” and are brought back to the main page.
